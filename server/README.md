# Full-Stack Task Manager - Server

This is the server-side application for the Full-Stack Task Manager project. It handles the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks and interacts with the database.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `src/models/Task.js`: This file exports a Mongoose model `Task` which represents a task. It defines the schema for the task data.

- `src/routes/tasks.js`: This file exports an Express router which handles the CRUD operations for tasks. It defines the routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

- `src/app.js`: This file is the entry point of the server-side application. It sets up the Express app, connects to the database, and registers the task routes.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the server-side application.

- `.env`: This file contains environment variables used in the server-side application, such as the database connection string.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the server-side application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the server directory: `cd full-stack-task-manager/server`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding the necessary variables.
5. Start the server: `npm start`

The server will start running on the specified port, and you can now make API requests to perform CRUD operations on tasks.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /tasks`: Get a list of all tasks.
- `GET /tasks/:id`: Get a specific task by ID.
- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update a specific task by ID.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task by ID.

Please refer to the `routes/tasks.js` file for detailed information on the request and response formats for each endpoint.

## Database

The server uses a database to store task data. The database connection string should be provided in the `.env` file. You can choose any database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and set up the necessary data models to represent tasks.

## Error Handling

The server handles errors gracefully and sends appropriate error messages and status codes in response. Proper error handling ensures a smooth user experience and helps in debugging and troubleshooting.

## Testing

Unit tests have been written for critical components of the server-side application, such as API endpoints and data validation. These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. To run the tests, use the command `npm test`.

## Security

Basic security measures have been implemented to protect the application from common vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to follow security best practices and perform a thorough security audit before deploying the application to a production environment.

## Additional Notes

Please refer to the client-side application documentation for information on the user interface, user experience, and additional features of the Full-Stack Task Manager project.
